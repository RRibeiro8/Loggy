We develop a web application in order to visualize and analyze the images that are retrieved by our system.
The retrieval method used is now more efficient and it follows a new approach.
From each topic are extracted manually the relevants words and divided into objects, activities and locations. The date and time are also considered.
The confidence of the retrieved images are computed using the cosine similarity and the score of the concept provided by the organizers.
The retrieved images was visualized and analyzed in order to exclude irrelevant images.
